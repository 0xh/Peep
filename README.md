# Peep
#### A modern desktop reddit client

Reddit is the quintessential platform which benifits from an unified app expereince. Because of this, there are many Reddit apps for iOS & Android. But, there aren't many option for desktop users and they are mostly left with Reddit web pages, which don't always have the best browsing expereince.

Peep is here to solve that problem! It will be an opensource equivalent to apps like Apollo on iOS or RedditSync on Android. They provide a much more batteries included access to Reddit communities & Peep will do the same for desktop users.

### Project Status
Currently Peep is very much in its infancy. It's build built on Electron platform, which will allow Peep to run on all major Desktops. Additionally, we are using Vue.js & Redux to build the UI and manage it's state.
